title: About Me
---
Hey! I'm Chandler, and I'm a software engineer based in the Midwest. I make my living at a small health tech startup, working primarily with Go. 

I got my passion for computing and technology at a young age. My grandfather and I would spend hours in his HAM radio lab, where he'd teach me all about computers, how electronic circuits work (and how to build them), and in general how to have fun *just by learning*. Despite the best efforts of an ADHD treatment regiment, that relentless curiosity is still with me.

Some of the broader technical areas that have been of interest to me are:
- Learning the strengths and weaknesses of various programming languages and paradigms
- Systems programming, Linux/UNIX internals
- Embedded systems
- Linux ricing (I do use Arch, btw)
- Network stacks

I started this blog to hopefully brush off my writing skills, and also share some of the things I'm learning about or hacking on. Thanks for checking it out!

If you want to get in touch with me, you can reach me at [contact@bitcrshr.dev](mailto:contact@bitcrshr.dev). You can also find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/bitcrshr) and [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcrshr).

> Inside every single one of us is two people. ... There's the mathematician in all of us. He likes right angles. He likes equations. He likes composability. He hates duplication. *Abhors* duplication. He's always looking for the ultimate answer to everything. He wants those five equations that govern the entire operation of the universe and distill them down to their essence. There's never a problem that he's met that he can't solve with more math, more type theory, more language features... Precision and perfection are the name of his game.

The pragmatist just wants to solve the job; get it done and ship it. The pragmatist has never met a problem that cannot be solved with a big hammer and a big roll of duct tape.
